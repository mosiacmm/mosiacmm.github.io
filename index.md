        testimonial: "The successful adoption of a federal system hinges upon our collective dedication to collaborative nation-building. This commitment is undeniably paramount. Minorities hold significant importance as well; they are integral citizens contributing to our nation. Their worth must be recognized and upheld. The march towards a federal framework becomes feasible when each individual's rights are safeguarded. Unity serves as a potent force, and its widespread acceptance promises the transformation of our country into a progressive and thriving federal entity."

        testimonial: "Federalism occupies a key role in the ongoing peace process. It is imperative that our citizens are well-informed about federalism before our country transitions into a federal structure. With the valuable insights we've gained through Mosaic Myanmar, we are actively seeking avenues to put this acquired knowledge into practical use."

        testimonial: "I am of the opinion that additional training sessions and workshops of this nature are crucial. Our current understanding of federalism is notably limited. Personally, as someone rooted in the education sector, I attended this training with the purpose of subsequently transmitting these concepts and ideas to the younger generation. Now, allow me to reflect on our discussions today. We were provided with a valuable opportunity to delve into various aspects, including the diverse forms of federalism, the practical implementations across global federal nations, the vulnerabilities inherent in federal systems, and the factors contributing to their emergence."
